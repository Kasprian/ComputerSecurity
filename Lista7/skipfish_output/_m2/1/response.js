By contrast, the GNU General Public\x0aLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\x0asoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\x0aGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\x0aFoundation\x27s software and to any other program whose authors commit to\x0ausing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\x0athe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\x0ayour programs, too.\x0a\x0a  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\x0aprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\x0ahave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\x0athis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\x0aif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\x0ain new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\x0a\x0a  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\x0aanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\x0aThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\x0adistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\x0a\x0a  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\x0agratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\x0ayou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\x0asource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\x0arights.\x0a\x0a  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\x0a(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\x0adistribute and/or modify the software.\x0a\x0a  Also, for each author\x27s protection and ours, we want to make certain\x0athat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\x0asoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\x0awant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\x0athat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\x0aauthors\x27 reputations.\x0a\x0a  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\x0apatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\x0aprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\x0aprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\x0apatent must be licensed for everyone\x27s free use or not licensed at all.\x0a\x0a  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\x0amodification follow.\x0a\x0a                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\x0a   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\x0a\x0a  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\x0aa notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\x0aunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \x22Program\x22, below,\x0arefers to any such program or work, and a \x22work based on the Program\x22\x0ameans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\x0athat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\x0aeither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\x0alanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\x0athe term \x22modification\x22.)  Each licensee is addressed as \x22you\x22.\x0a\x0aActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\x0acovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\x0arunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\x0ais covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\x0aProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\x0aWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\x0a\x0a  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\x27s\x0asource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\x0aconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\x0acopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\x0anotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\x0aand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\x0aalong with the Program.\x0a\x0aYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\x0ayou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\x0a\x0a  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\x0aof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\x0adistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\x0aabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\x0a\x0a    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\x0a    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\x0a\x0a    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\x0a    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\x0a    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\x0a    parties under the terms of this License.\x0a\x0a    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\x0a    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\x0a    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\x0a    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\x0a    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\x0a    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\x0a    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\x0a    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\x0a    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\x0a    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\x0a\x0aThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\x0aidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\x0aand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\x0athemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\x0asections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\x0adistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\x0aon the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\x0athis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\x0aentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\x0a\x0aThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\x0ayour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\x0aexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\x0acollective works based on the Program.\x0a\x0aIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\x0awith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\x0aa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\x0athe scope of this License.\x0a\x0a  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\x0aunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\x0aSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\x0a\x0a    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\x0a    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\x0a    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\x0a\x0a    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\x0a    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\x0a    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\x0a    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\x0a    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\x0a    customarily used for software interchange; or,\x0a\x0a    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\x0a    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\x0a    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\x0a    received the program in object code or executable form with such\x0a    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\x0a\x0aThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\x0amaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\x0acode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\x0aassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\x0acontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\x0aspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\x0aanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\x0aform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\x0aoperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\x0aitself accompanies the executable.\x0a\x0aIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\x0aaccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\x0aaccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\x0adistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\x0acompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\x0a\x0a  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\x0aexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\x0aotherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\x0avoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\x0aHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\x0athis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\x0aparties remain in full compliance.\x0a\x0a  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\x0asigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\x0adistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\x0aprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\x0amodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\x0aProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\x0aall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\x0athe Program or works based on it.\x0a\x0a  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\x0aProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\x0aoriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\x0athese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\x0arestrictions on the recipients\x27 exercise of the rights granted herein.\x0aYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\x0athis License.\x0a\x0a  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\x0ainfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\x0aconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\x0aotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\x0aexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\x0adistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\x0aLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\x0amay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\x0alicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\x0aall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\x0athe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\x0arefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\x0a\x0aIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\x0aany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\x0aapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\x0acircumstances.\x0a\x0aIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\x0apatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\x0asuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\x0aintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\x0aimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\x0agenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\x0athrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\x0asystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\x0ato distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\x0aimpose that choice.\x0a\x0aThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\x0abe a consequence of the rest of this License.\x0a\x0a  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\x0acertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\x0aoriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\x0amay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\x0athose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\x0acountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\x0athe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\x0a\x0a  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\x0aof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\x0abe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\x0aaddress new problems or concerns.\x0a\x0aEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\x0aspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \x22any\x0alater version\x22, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\x0aeither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\x0aSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\x0athis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\x0aFoundation.\x0a\x0a  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\x0aprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\x0ato ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\x0aSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\x0amake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\x0aof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\x0aof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\x0a\x0a                            NO WARRANTY\x0a\x0a  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\x0aFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\x0aOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\x0aPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \x22AS IS\x22 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\x0aOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\x0aMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\x0aTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\x0aPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\x0aREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\x0a\x0a  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\x0aWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\x0aREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\x0aINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\x0aOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\x0aTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\x0aYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\x0aPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\x0aPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\x0a\x0a                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\x0a\x0a            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\x0a\x0a  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\x0apossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\x0afree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\x0a\x0a  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\x0ato attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\x0aconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\x0athe \x22copyright\x22 line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\x0a\x0a    \x3cone line to give the program\x27s name and a brief idea of what it does.\x3e\x0a    Copyright (C) \x3cyear\x3e  \x3cname of author\x3e\x0a\x0a    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\x0a    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\x0a    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\x0a    (at your option) any later version.\x0a\x0a    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\x0a    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\x0a    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\x0a    GNU General Public License for more details.\x0a\x0a    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\x0a    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\x0a    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\x0a\x0aAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\x0a\x0aIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\x0awhen it starts in an interactive mode:\x0a\x0a    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\x0a    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w\x27.\x0a    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\x0a    under certain conditions; type `show c\x27 for details.\x0a\x0aThe hypothetical commands `show w\x27 and `show c\x27 should show the appropriate\x0aparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\x0abe called something other than `show w\x27 and `show c\x27; they could even be\x0amouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\x0a\x0aYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\x0aschool, if any, to sign a \x22copyright disclaimer\x22 for the program, if\x0anecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\x0a\x0a  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\x0a  `Gnomovision\x27 (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\x0a\x0a  \x3csignature of Ty Coon\x3e, 1 April 1989\x0a  Ty Coon, President of Vice\x0a\x0aThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\x0aproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\x0aconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\x0alibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\x0aPublic License instead of this License.\x0a'}
